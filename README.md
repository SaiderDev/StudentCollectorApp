<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The 'Student Collector App' adds, removes and stores student data to our database. This application is a backend application implementable on the terminal. It uses node.js along with some cool modules. 

The Application:
* starts with importing modules such as File system in order to read and write files to our database which in this case is a .JSON file. Subsequently, the yargs module was installed from npm. The yargs module allows command creation. 
* The files provided show a students.js file which is where functionality for the app is written. Here we create functions such as add students, remove student and read student which perform functions on our database.
* This application is backend application as it focuses on appending data to the database,reading and removing data. These are key areas to maintain data of any organisation.

The application commands are very easy and user friendly. An example of such a command is provided below:

Use the following command on the terminal `node index.js add --name="Jane Doe` to add a student on the database. More commands are avaialble on the index.js file.
